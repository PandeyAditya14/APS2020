** Bellman-Ford Exercise **
==================

1. Comment on efficiency of Bellman-Ford's algorithm. 

2. What is the right data structure to implement Bellman-Ford?

3. What does Bellman-Ford's compute? 

4. What is a negative edge and what is a negative cycle?

5. Why does the algorithm work even if there are negative weight edges? 

6. Which is better, Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford?

7. Differentiate between Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford.
