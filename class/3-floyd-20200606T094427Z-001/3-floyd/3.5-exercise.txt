** Floyd Exercise **
==================

1. Comment on efficiency of Floyd's algorithm. 

2. What is the right data structure to implement Floyd?

3. What does Floyd's compute? 

4. Does the algorithm still work if the graph has negative weights?

5. Can we do better than cubic efficiency? 

6. Why does Floyd's algorithm work? Explain the intuition.
