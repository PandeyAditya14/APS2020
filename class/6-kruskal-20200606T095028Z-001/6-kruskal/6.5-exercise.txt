2. What is the right data structure to implement Kruskal?

3. What does Kruskal's compute? 

4. Does the algorithm work if graph has two or more components?

5. What is the right data structure to implement Kruskal?

6. What happens if we stop the algorithm in the middle?

7. Differenciate between Kruskal and Prim.
